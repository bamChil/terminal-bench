task_statement: '**Task: Implement a Configurable Pretty Printer for Python Objects**


  **Core Functionalities:**

  - Format complex Python data structures (dictionaries, lists, tuples, sets, dataclasses,
  etc.) into human-readable, indented text representations

  - Provide intelligent line wrapping and layout control based on configurable width
  constraints

  - Handle nested objects with proper indentation levels and depth limiting


  **Main Features & Requirements:**

  - **Configurable formatting**: Support customizable indentation spacing, maximum
  line width, and maximum nesting depth

  - **Type-specific formatting**: Implement specialized formatters for different object
  types (dicts, lists, strings, bytes, collections, etc.)

  - **Intelligent layout**: Break long lines appropriately, wrap text at word boundaries,
  and maintain readable structure

  - **Circular reference detection**: Safely handle self-referencing objects without
  infinite recursion

  - **Stream-based output**: Write formatted results directly to output streams for
  memory efficiency


  **Key Challenges:**

  - **Recursion management**: Track object IDs to detect and handle circular references
  gracefully

  - **Width calculation**: Balance line length constraints with readability across
  nested structures

  - **Type dispatch**: Route different object types to appropriate specialized formatting
  methods

  - **Context preservation**: Maintain proper indentation and formatting state across
  recursive calls

  - **Performance optimization**: Handle large or deeply nested data structures efficiently


  The task requires building a robust, extensible pretty-printing system that produces
  consistently formatted, readable output while handling edge cases like circular
  references and deeply nested structures.'

interface_code1: "class PrettyPrinter:\n    \"\"\"\n    A configurable pretty printer\
  \ for Python objects that formats complex data structures\n    in a human-readable\
  \ way with proper indentation and line wrapping.\n    \n    The PrettyPrinter class\
  \ provides sophisticated formatting capabilities for nested data\n    structures\
  \ like dictionaries, lists, tuples, sets, dataclasses, and other Python objects.\n\
  \    It intelligently handles line wrapping, indentation, and recursion detection\
  \ to produce\n    clean, readable output that respects specified width constraints.\n\
  \    \n    Attributes:\n        _indent_per_level (int): Number of spaces to indent\
  \ for each nesting level\n        _width (int): Maximum number of columns attempted\
  \ in output formatting  \n        _depth (int | None): Maximum depth to traverse\
  \ when formatting nested structures\n    \n    Methods:\n        __init__(indent=4,\
  \ width=80, depth=None): \n            Initialize the pretty printer with formatting\
  \ parameters.\n            \n            Args:\n                indent: Spaces per\
  \ indentation level (must be >= 0)\n                width: Target maximum line width\
  \ (must be != 0) \n                depth: Maximum nesting depth to format (must\
  \ be > 0 if specified)\n                \n        pformat(object):\n           \
  \ Format an object and return the result as a string.\n            \n          \
  \  Args:\n                object: Any Python object to format\n                \n\
  \            Returns:\n                str: Pretty-formatted string representation\n\
  \                \n        _format(object, stream, indent, allowance, context, level):\n\
  \            Internal method that handles the core formatting logic. Writes formatted\n\
  \            output directly to a stream, managing indentation, recursion detection,\n\
  \            and dispatching to specialized formatters for different object types.\n\
  \            \n        _pprint_dataclass(object, stream, indent, allowance, context,\
  \ level):\n            Specialized formatter for dataclass instances. Formats dataclasses\
  \ with\n            their class name followed by field names and values in a readable\
  \ layout.\n            \n        _pprint_dict(object, stream, indent, allowance,\
  \ context, level):\n            Specialized formatter for dictionary objects. Handles\
  \ key-value pair\n            formatting with proper indentation and sorting for\
  \ consistent output.\n    \n    Usage Examples:\n        # Basic usage with default\
  \ settings\n        pp = PrettyPrinter()\n        data = {'users': [{'name': 'Alice',\
  \ 'age': 30}, {'name': 'Bob', 'age': 25}]}\n        formatted = pp.pformat(data)\n\
  \        \n        # Custom indentation and width\n        pp = PrettyPrinter(indent=2,\
  \ width=60)\n        nested_list = [[1, 2, [3, 4]], [5, 6, [7, 8, [9, 10]]]]\n \
  \       print(pp.pformat(nested_list))\n        \n        # Limit formatting depth\n\
  \        pp = PrettyPrinter(depth=2)\n        deep_structure = {'a': {'b': {'c':\
  \ {'d': 'too deep'}}}}\n        formatted = pp.pformat(deep_structure)  # Will truncate\
  \ at depth 2\n    \"\"\"\n\n    _dispatch = {}\n\n    def __init__(\n        self,\n\
  \        indent: int = 4,\n        width: int = 80,\n        depth: int | None =\
  \ None\n    ) -> None:\n        \"\"\"\n        Handle pretty printing operations\
  \ onto a stream using a set of\n                configured parameters.\n\n     \
  \           indent\n                    Number of spaces to indent for each level\
  \ of nesting.\n\n                width\n                    Attempted maximum number\
  \ of columns in the output.\n\n                depth\n                    The maximum\

  \n    def pformat(self, object: Any) -> str:\n        \"\"\"\n        Format an\
  \ object into a pretty-printed string representation.\n\n        This method converts\
  \ any Python object into a formatted string with proper\n        indentation and\
  \ line breaks according to the PrettyPrinter's configuration\n        settings (width,\
  \ depth, and indent).\n\n        Parameters\n        ----------\n        object\
  \ : Any\n            The Python object to be formatted. Can be any type including\
  \ built-in\n            types (dict, list, tuple, set, str, bytes, etc.), custom\
  \ classes,\n            dataclasses, or nested structures.\n\n        Returns\n\
  \        -------\n        str\n            A formatted string representation of\
  \ the object with appropriate\n            indentation, line breaks, and structure\
  \ formatting. The output\n            respects the PrettyPrinter's width limit and\
  \ will break long lines\n            when necessary.\n\n        Notes\n        -----\n\
  \        - The formatting behavior varies based on object type:\n          * Dictionaries\
  \ are sorted by key and formatted with proper indentation\n          * Lists and\
  \ tuples show each element on separate lines for complex structures\n          *\
  \ Strings are intelligently wrapped at word boundaries when they exceed width\n\
  \          * Dataclasses are formatted showing field names and values\n        \
  \  * Circular references are detected and displayed as recursion indicators\n  \
  \      - If the depth limit is set and exceeded, nested structures will be truncated\n\
  \          with ellipsis notation\n        - The method handles special cases like\
  \ empty containers, single-element tuples,\n          and various collection types\
  \ from the collections module\n        - Output formatting is optimized for readability\
  \ while respecting the configured\n          width constraints\n        \"\"\"\n\

  \     Format an object for pretty printing by writing its representation to a stream.\n\
  \n        This is the core formatting method that handles the pretty printing of\
  \ any Python object.\n        It determines the appropriate formatting strategy\
  \ based on the object's type and handles\n        circular reference detection.\n\
  \n        Parameters:\n            object (Any): The Python object to be formatted\
  \ and written to the stream.\n            stream (IO[str]): The text stream where\
  \ the formatted representation will be written.\n            indent (int): The current\
  \ indentation level in spaces from the left margin.\n            allowance (int):\
  \ The number of characters to reserve at the end of the current line\n         \
  \                   for closing brackets, parentheses, or other delimiters.\n  \
  \          context (set[int]): A set containing the object IDs of all objects currently\
  \ being\n                               processed, used for detecting and handling\
  \ circular references.\n            level (int): The current nesting depth level,\
  \ used for depth limiting and formatting\n                        decisions.\n\n\
  \        Returns:\n            None: This method writes directly to the provided\
  \ stream and returns nothing.\n\n        Important Notes:\n            - Circular\
  \ references are detected using the context set and are represented with\n     \
  \         a special recursion marker instead of causing infinite loops.\n      \
  \      - The method uses a dispatch table (_dispatch) to find specialized formatting\n\
  \              functions for different object types based on their __repr__ method.\n\
  \            - Special handling is provided for dataclasses that have auto-generated\
  \ repr methods.\n            - If no specialized formatter is found, the method\
  \ falls back to using the object's\n              standard repr() representation.\n\
  \            - The object ID is temporarily added to the context set during processing\

  \ then formatting them in a readable structure. It writes\n        the class name\
  \ followed by parentheses containing the formatted field assignments.\n\n      \
  \  Parameters:\n            object (Any): The dataclass instance to be pretty printed.\

  \ in the format: ClassName(field1=value1, field2=value2, ...)\n            - Handles\
  \ nested structures by delegating to _format_namespace_items for proper\n      \
  \        indentation and line breaking\n            - The object ID is managed in\
